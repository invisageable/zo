# notes — design.

My vision of a programming language has led me to believe that a language must be simple, expressive and, above all, flexible. By this I mean that a language that wants to be modern must be accompanied by a series of satellite tools that will extend the range of possibilities in my experience of creating software. This is the correlation to my productivity - having an ecosystem capable of responding to my needs as quickly as possible to satisfy my creativity.   

With this in mind, I started designing zo, inspired by languages like Ocaml, Rust and Elixir. My goal is to create a robust ecosystem. The first tool I'm going to focus on is a code editor. Today, I still don't have a code editor that meets my needs. Starting with the user interface, none of them meet my expectations as a creative programmer. I understand their choices and respect them, but there are other paths to take.   

Before that, I'll make sure I've written a toy version of the language. The bare minimum for writing simple projects, writing code challenges like Advent Of Code, Euler Project. This minimal version will enable me to incorporate it into a code editor that will have a significantly positive impact on my developments.
