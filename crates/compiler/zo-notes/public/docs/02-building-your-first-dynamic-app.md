Chapter 2: Building Your First Interactive App (A Counter)

    Goal: Immediate gratification and a taste of zo's magic.

    Project: A simple counter button.

    Concepts Introduced: imu and mut for reactive state, the ::= template operator, handling onclick events with simple functions. This is the zo equivalent of Rust's "Guessing Game" but is far more exciting because it's a real, interactive UI.
