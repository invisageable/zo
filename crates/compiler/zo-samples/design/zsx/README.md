> *zo Syntax Extension — an embedded templating langage.*

## about.

zsx is a zo syntax extension embedded into the language. It takes his inspiration from E4X but it does not follow his way. But s/o to the engineers who works on E4X, you guys rocks! In zsx, there is two primary elements:

- [`Elmt`]: an xml-like element — `<foo />`, `<bar></bar>`.
- [`Text`]: an html-like text — `foobar ra boo far boof`.

## syntax.

The syntax is similar to his old brother with some changes because zsx is more focus on web compatibilities. zsx supports a html elements. See also [syntax](../../examples/templating) for more information.
