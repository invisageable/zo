## about.

Examples as a proof of concept of the the feasability of running a `.zo` file is possible. The goal is to implement many the basic, recurrent programs as I can. It will be a good way to learn zo in a pratical manner.

- [factorial](./factorial.zo)
- [fibonacci](./fibonacci.zo)
- [fizzbuzz](./fizzbuzz.zo)
- [gcd](./gcd.zo)
- [hello](./hello.zo)
- [square-root](./square-root.zo)
